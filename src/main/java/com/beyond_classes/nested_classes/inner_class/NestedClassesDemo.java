        Nested Classes
            - Nested class is a class defined within another class

            - Types of Nested Classes
                - Inner Class
                    - non-static type, defined at the member level of a class
                - Static Nested Class
                    - static type, defined at the member level of a class
                - Local Class
                    - a class defined within a method body
                - Anonymous Class
                    - local class which doesn't have a name

            - Inner Class
                - can have access modifier
                - can extend another class and/ or implement interfaces
                - can be marked abstract or final
                - can access all members of the enclosing class (including private members)

            - nested class can have their own nested classes

            - Static Nested Class
                - can't access instance variables or method declared in the outer class
                - you don't need an instance of the wider class to access it
                - can be marked private or protected

            - Local Class
                - nested class defined within a method
                    - limited scope
                - don't have access modifiers
                - can be abstract or final
                - can access all members of the enclosing class
                - can access final and effectively final local variables

            - Anonymous Class
                - special type of local class which doesn't have a name
                - must extend an existing class or implement an existing interface
